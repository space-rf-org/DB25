  ⏺ Update Todos

       ☒ Test Make build system
       ☒ Identify and fix any discrepancies

  ⏺ Summary: Makefile and CMakeLists.txt Synchronization

    ✅ Successfully synchronized both build systems!

    Issues Found and Fixed:

    1. Missing Executables:
      - Issue: CMakeLists.txt only built example, missed planning_demo and physical_demo
      - Fix: Added both missing executables to CMakeLists.txt
    2. Inconsistent Optimization Flags:
      - Issue: Makefile used -O2, CMake used -O3
      - Fix: Changed CMake to use -O2 to match Makefile
    3. Warning Flags Mismatch:
      - Issue: CMake only applied -Wall -Wextra in debug mode, Makefile applied them always
      - Fix: Made CMake apply warning flags in all build modes
    4. Library Naming:
      - Note: CMake creates liblib_pg_cpp.a, Makefile creates libpg_cpp.a (minor difference due to CMake conventions)

    Verification Results:

    Both build systems now produce:
    - ✅ Same executables: example, planning_demo, physical_demo
    - ✅ Same compiler flags: -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -O2
    - ✅ Same warnings: Identical warning output from both builds
    - ✅ Same functionality: All executables run correctly from both build systems
    - ✅ Same library linking: Both use libpg_query.a and pthread

    Test Results:

    - Makefile build: ✅ All 3 executables built and tested successfully
    - CMake build: ✅ All 3 executables built and tested successfully
    - Namespace: ✅ Both systems correctly use db25 namespace
    - Compatibility: ✅ Both build systems are now fully synchronized

    The Makefile and CMakeLists.txt are now in perfect sync and produce equivalent builds!

  Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Change namespace from 'pg' to 'db25' in all header files
     ☒ Change namespace from 'pg' to 'db25' in all source files
     ☒ Update CMakeLists.txt if it references the namespace
     ☒ Build and test all components to ensure everything works

⏺ Summary

  Successfully changed the namespace from 'pg' to 'db25' throughout the entire project and tested everything:

  Completed Tasks:

  1. Updated all header files - Changed namespace declarations in all 9 header files
  2. Updated all source files - Changed namespace declarations in all 8 source files
  3. Updated examples - Changed all namespace references in main.cpp, planning_demo.cpp, and physical_demo.cpp
  4. Updated documentation - Changed namespace references in README.md and LaTeX documentation
  5. Full testing - Built and tested all three demos successfully

  Files Modified:

  - Header files: 9 files updated (query_executor.hpp, database.hpp, physical_plan.hpp, etc.)
  - Source files: 8 files updated (all .cpp files in src/)
  - Example files: 3 files updated (all .cpp files in examples/)
  - Documentation: README.md and query_engine_architecture.tex

  Test Results:

  - ✅ Basic demo: All query parsing, validation, and schema operations working
  - ✅ Logical planning demo: Query planning and optimization working
  - ✅ Physical demo: Physical plan generation and execution working
  - ✅ Build: Clean compilation with only minor unused parameter warnings

  The entire DB25 project now uses the db25 namespace consistently and all components are functioning correctly.
