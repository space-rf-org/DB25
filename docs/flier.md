DB25: Open Research Collaboration for Next-Generation Database Systems
We invite the database systems community to contribute to DB25, an open-source HTAP database system addressing critical infrastructure challenges in unified transactional and analytical processing with computational storage integration.
Research Motivation: Modern data workloads—including machine learning pipelines, real-time analytics, and high-throughput applications—demand database architectures that eliminate traditional ETL bottlenecks and storage-compute separation. DB25 explores unified processing paradigms with near-data computation capabilities.
Technical Contributions Sought:

Systems Architecture: Query optimization and execution engine refinement in C++17
Computational Storage: Near-data processing algorithms and storage-compute co-design
Real-time Processing: Unified OLTP/OLAP for streaming analytics and feature engineering
Workload Optimization: Cross-workload performance for diverse applications (ML training, real-time analytics, traditional OLAP)
Storage Systems: Advanced computational storage integration and optimization
Empirical Evaluation: Benchmarking frameworks for modern data processing scenarios

Current State & Research Opportunities:
DB25 features a complete query processing pipeline with computational storage foundations, addressing infrastructure demands of contemporary data-intensive applications. Our 33-page technical documentation covers both traditional HTAP and emerging computational storage paradigms.
Research Impact:

Advance database systems research for demanding contemporary workloads
Explore computational storage paradigms in database architectures
Investigate unified data processing for real-time analytics and machine learning
Bridge academic database research with practical implementation challenges
Address storage-compute separation limiting modern data system scalability

Ideal for: Database researchers, systems engineers working on data infrastructure, graduate students investigating computational storage, and practitioners building next-generation data platforms.
