For someone wanting to contribute to DB25:

1. Getting Started: Follow the setup instructions in the README.md - install libpg_query and build the project using either Make or CMake
2. Understanding the System: Run the three demo programs to understand DB25's capabilities:
   - make example - Basic SQL parsing and schema management
   - make planning_demo - Logical query planning
   - make execution_demo - Physical execution engine
3. Research Areas (from docs/flier.md):
   - Systems Architecture: Query optimization and execution engine refinement in C++17
   - Computational Storage: Near-data processing algorithms and storage-compute co-design
   - Real-time Processing: Unified OLTP/OLAP for streaming analytics
   - Workload Optimization: Cross-workload performance optimization
   - Empirical Evaluation: Benchmarking frameworks
4. Contribution Process (from README.md line 545):
   - Fork the repository (github.com/space-rf-org/DB25)
   - Create a feature branch
   - Make changes following existing code conventions
   - Add tests if applicable
   - Submit a pull request
5. Documentation: Review the 33-page technical documentation in docs/query_engine_architecture.tex to understand the HTAP architecture

Key Message: DB25 is an open research collaboration seeking contributors to advance next-generation database systems with HTAP and computational storage capabilities.
