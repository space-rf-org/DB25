## üîß Building the Documentation

### Prerequisites

You need a LaTeX distribution with the following packages:
- `tikz` (for diagrams)
- `pgfplots` (for charts)
- `listings` (for code syntax highlighting)
- `algorithm` and `algorithmic` (for algorithms)
- Standard packages: `amsmath`, `graphicx`, `hyperref`, etc.

### macOS Installation
```bash
# Install MacTeX (full distribution)
brew install --cask mactex

# Or install BasicTeX (minimal) and add packages
brew install --cask basictex
sudo tlmgr update --self
sudo tlmgr install tikz pgfplots listings algorithm2e booktabs
```

### Ubuntu/Debian Installation
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install texlive-full
```

### Building the PDF

```bash
# Make script executable (if not already)
chmod +x build_pdf.sh

# Build the PDF
./build_pdf.sh
```

The script will:
1. Run `pdflatex` multiple times (for references and table of contents)
2. Clean up auxiliary files
3. Report success/failure and file statistics
