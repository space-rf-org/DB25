# üöÄ DB25 Release Notes: AST-Based ORDER BY Parsing Enhancement

## Version: AST ORDER BY Parsing v1.0
**Release Date:** August 2025  
**Enhancement Type:** Query Planning Enhancement  
**Build:** AST-Enhanced Query Processing v2.0

---

## üìã Overview

This release introduces a significant enhancement to the DB25 database system's query planner with **AST-based ORDER BY parsing**, replacing the previous regex-based approach with a robust, PostgreSQL AST-powered solution. This enhancement dramatically improves the accuracy and capabilities of ORDER BY clause parsing, enabling support for complex expressions, functions, and advanced SQL sorting constructs.

## ‚ú® New Features

### üéØ **AST-Based ORDER BY Parsing**
- **Complete PostgreSQL AST Integration**: Leverages libpg_query for accurate SQL ORDER BY parsing
- **Intelligent Expression Tree Construction**: Builds proper expression trees for complex sort expressions
- **Enhanced Sort Clause Support**: Handles all ORDER BY types with full fidelity
- **Multi-Key Sorting**: Full support for multiple sort keys with individual direction control

### üîß **Supported ORDER BY Types**

#### **1. Basic Column Ordering**
```sql
-- Simple columns
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY name;
SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY price DESC;

-- Qualified columns  
SELECT u.name, p.title FROM users u JOIN posts p ON u.id = p.user_id ORDER BY u.created_date;

-- Multiple columns with mixed directions
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY department ASC, salary DESC, name ASC;
```

#### **2. Function-Based Ordering** 
```sql
-- String functions
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY UPPER(name);
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY LENGTH(email) DESC;

-- Aggregate functions in subqueries
SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE product_id = products.id) DESC;

-- Date functions
SELECT * FROM events ORDER BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM event_date), EXTRACT(MONTH FROM event_date);
```

#### **3. Expression-Based Ordering**
```sql
-- Arithmetic expressions
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary * 1.1;
SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY (price - discount) DESC;

-- Complex expressions
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY (age / 10) + priority_score;

-- Conditional expressions
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY CASE WHEN vip_status THEN 0 ELSE 1 END, name;
```

#### **4. CASE Expression Ordering**
```sql
-- Simple CASE in ORDER BY
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY CASE WHEN age > 65 THEN 'senior' ELSE 'regular' END;

-- Complex CASE with multiple conditions
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY 
    CASE 
        WHEN department = 'executive' THEN 1
        WHEN department = 'management' THEN 2 
        ELSE 3
    END, salary DESC;
```

#### **5. Direction and NULLS Handling**
```sql
-- Explicit direction control
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY name ASC, age DESC;

-- NULLS positioning (parsed and documented for future extension)
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY email NULLS FIRST;
SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY description NULLS LAST;
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### **Core Components Added**

#### **1. Primary ORDER BY Method**
```cpp
// Main ORDER BY extraction from AST
std::vector<SortNode::SortKey> extract_order_by_from_ast(const std::string& query) const;
```

#### **2. Enhanced Query Planning Flow**
```cpp
// Before (lines 864-878): Regex-based parsing
std::regex order_regex(R"(ORDER\s+BY\s+(.+?)(?:\s+LIMIT|$))", std::regex_constants::icase);
// Limited to simple single-column sorting with basic direction parsing

// After: AST-based parsing  
if (auto sort_keys = extract_order_by_from_ast(query); !sort_keys.empty()) {
    auto sort_node = std::make_shared<SortNode>();
    sort_node->children.push_back(plan_root);
    sort_node->sort_keys = std::move(sort_keys);
    plan_root = sort_node;
}
```

#### **3. Sort Key Structure Enhancement**
- **Expression Parsing**: Uses existing `parse_expression_from_ast()` for consistency
- **Direction Detection**: Accurate ASC/DESC parsing from PostgreSQL AST
- **NULLS Handling**: Framework for NULLS FIRST/LAST (documented for future extension)
- **Multi-Key Support**: Native support for complex multi-column sorting

#### **4. AST Navigation Structure**
```json
{
  "SelectStmt": {
    "sortClause": [
      {
        "SortBy": {
          "node": { /* Expression AST */ },
          "sortby_dir": 1,  // SORTBY_ASC=1, SORTBY_DESC=2, SORTBY_DEFAULT=0
          "sortby_nulls": 0 // SORTBY_NULLS_DEFAULT=0, NULLS_FIRST=1, NULLS_LAST=2
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## üéØ Usage Examples

### **Before vs. After Comparison**

#### **Complex Multi-Key Sort Query**
```sql
SELECT u.name, u.age, d.name as dept_name,
       CASE WHEN u.salary > 100000 THEN 'high' ELSE 'normal' END as salary_level
FROM users u 
JOIN departments d ON u.dept_id = d.id 
WHERE u.active = true
ORDER BY d.priority ASC, 
         CASE WHEN u.salary > 100000 THEN 'high' ELSE 'normal' END DESC,
         UPPER(u.name) ASC;
```

**Before (Regex-based):**
- ‚ùå Failed to parse multiple sort keys
- ‚ùå Broken on CASE expression in ORDER BY
- ‚ùå Lost UPPER() function parsing
- ‚ùå Incorrect direction handling for multiple keys
- ‚ùå Could not handle qualified column references

**After (AST-based):**
- ‚úÖ Perfect multi-key sort parsing
- ‚úÖ Complete CASE expression support in ORDER BY
- ‚úÖ Accurate function call parsing (UPPER)
- ‚úÖ Correct individual direction control (ASC/DESC)
- ‚úÖ Full qualified column support (d.priority)
- ‚úÖ Optimized query plan generation

## üèÅ Conclusion

The AST-based ORDER BY parsing enhancement represents another significant milestone in DB25's evolution toward enterprise-grade SQL processing capabilities. By leveraging PostgreSQL's proven parser technology, this release provides robust ORDER BY parsing that handles the full spectrum of SQL sorting constructs accurately and efficiently.

Combined with the existing AST-based projection and WHERE clause parsing, DB25 now offers a comprehensive AST-powered query processing pipeline that rivals commercial database systems while maintaining its lightweight and efficient design philosophy.

This enhancement establishes the foundation for advanced sorting optimizations and brings DB25 closer to full PostgreSQL ORDER BY compatibility.
